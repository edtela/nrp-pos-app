# NRP (Next Restaurant POS) - Development Roadmap

**Last Updated**: October 25, 2025
**Current Version**: 1.0.0
**Status**: Active Development â†’ Production Deployment

## Executive Summary

This roadmap outlines the path to production deployment for the Aromal restaurant POS system, with a focus on completing core functionality first, then incrementally improving architecture and code quality.

**Development Philosophy**: Ship â†’ Improve â†’ Refactor â†’ Repeat

---

## Current State Assessment

### âœ… Working Well
- **TSQN Integration**: Migrated to published v0.2.0 package
- **Custom Reactive System**: Proven architecture with surgical DOM updates
- **Menu System**: Multi-language support, hierarchical structure
- **Order Management**: Session-based persistence
- **ERPNext Integration**: API layer working
- **Development Experience**: Fast Vite builds, TypeScript type safety
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Playwright E2E tests in place

### ðŸŸ¡ Needs Attention
- Component pattern consistency
- Error handling standardization
- Offline capabilities (progressive enhancement)
- Production monitoring/logging
- Performance optimization opportunities

### ðŸ”´ Blockers for Production
- [ ] Complete missing POS features (see Production Requirements)
- [ ] Security audit (authentication, data validation)
- [ ] Load testing and performance benchmarking
- [ ] Production deployment configuration
- [ ] Error tracking and monitoring setup

---

## Architecture Principles

### Core Design Decisions

**1. Data-First Architecture**
- Business logic separate from UI
- Testable without DOM
- TSQN for immutable updates with change tracking

**2. Stateless Components**
```typescript
// Standard pattern
export function template(data: T, context: Context): Template
export function update(container: Element, changes: DataChange<T>): void
export const classes = { root: 'component-name', ... }
```

**3. Event-Driven Communication**
- Events flow up the DOM tree
- State managed at *Page level
- No component-to-component coupling
- No listener cleanup needed (query DOM on demand)

**4. SSG-Friendly**
- Templates work for both static generation and dynamic rendering
- Same code paths for build-time and runtime
- Progressive enhancement approach

**5. No Framework Philosophy**
- Direct DOM manipulation
- Custom templating (tagged template literals)
- Explicit over implicit
- Bundle size matters (~50KB vs 200KB+ for frameworks)

### Why This Approach?

**For POS Systems:**
- âœ… Performance critical (customer-facing transactions)
- âœ… Predictable scope (10-15 pages, known interactions)
- âœ… Offline requirements (service workers + static generation)
- âœ… Long-term stability (no framework upgrade cycles)
- âœ… Deep understanding (team owns all the code)

**Trade-offs Accepted:**
- More boilerplate than frameworks
- Smaller talent pool (must train on custom patterns)
- Building common features from scratch
- Documentation burden on team

## Development Phases

### **Phase 1: Production Deployment** (Priority: HIGH)
*Timeline: 1-2 months*

**Goal**: Get NRP running in production at all three locations (Kontakt, Kika, Delijorgji)

**Tasks**:
1. Complete missing POS features (payment, order lifecycle)
2. Security hardening (auth, validation)
3. Error handling and offline support
4. Load testing and performance optimization
5. Production deployment setup
6. Staff training materials

**Success Criteria**:
- All three stores using NRP for daily operations
- Zero critical bugs in first week
- Performance meets targets (<2s page load, <100ms interactions)
- Staff comfortable with interface

---

### **Phase 2: Post-Launch Stabilization** (Priority: MEDIUM)
*Timeline: 1 month after launch*

**Goal**: Address production issues and quick wins

**Tasks**:
1. Monitor and fix production bugs
2. Performance optimization based on real usage
3. Gather user feedback and prioritize improvements
4. Component pattern standardization (low-hanging fruit)
5. Documentation updates based on lessons learned

**Refactoring Checkpoints**:
- Standardize 3-5 high-traffic components as reference
- Document final component pattern
- Create component generator script

---

### **Phase 3: Architecture Cleanup** (Priority: MEDIUM)
*Timeline: 2-3 months after launch*

**Goal**: Systematic refactoring while maintaining production stability

**Tasks**:
1. **Component Standardization**
   - Refactor all components to match reference pattern
   - Ensure consistent update function signatures
   - Export classes consistently
   - Add component tests

2. **TSQN Enhancement**
   - Implement Transform operation (if needed for NRP)
   - Expand TSQN documentation with NRP examples
   - Consider extracting data-model patterns as library

3. **Code Quality**
   - Address TypeScript strict mode issues
   - Remove unused code
   - Improve test coverage (target: 80%)
   - Performance profiling and optimization

4. **Developer Experience**
   - Component generator CLI
   - Better error messages in dev mode
   - Development documentation
   - Onboarding guide for new developers

**Refactoring Approach**:
- One component file per session
- Test before and after
- Deploy incrementally
- Monitor production for regressions

---

### **Phase 4: Feature Enhancements** (Priority: LOW)
*Timeline: 6+ months after launch*

**Goal**: New features based on business needs

**Potential Features**:
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Customer loyalty program
- Online ordering integration
- Inventory management
- Employee time tracking
- Multi-currency support
- Advanced table management

**TSQN Evolution**:
- Complete Transform implementation
- Predicate system expansion
- Performance optimizations
- Marketing/documentation push

---

## Incremental Improvement Strategy

### During Development (Phase 1)

**Every Sprint:**
- Standardize 1-2 components as you touch them
- Add tests for new features
- Update documentation for changes
- Review and improve error handling

**Don't:**
- Do large refactoring during feature work
- Change patterns mid-sprint
- Optimize prematurely
- Perfect code before shipping

### Refactoring Sessions

**Schedule**: Every 2-3 weeks after production launch

**Format**:
1. Review production metrics and user feedback
2. Identify 3-5 improvement opportunities
3. Prioritize by: Impact Ã— Ease
4. Execute highest priority items
5. Deploy and monitor

**Rules**:
- Time-boxed (2-4 hours max)
- Test coverage required
- Deploy same day or revert
- Document changes in this file

## Technical Debt Tracking

### High Priority
*(Blocking production or causing frequent issues)*

1. **Incomplete features** - See Production Requirements
2. **Security hardening** - Auth, validation, XSS prevention
3. **Error handling** - Graceful degradation, user-friendly errors

### Medium Priority
*(Should address post-launch)*

1. **Component pattern inconsistencies** - Some don't follow standard
2. **TypeScript errors** - Few remaining strict mode issues
3. **Test coverage gaps** - Critical paths need more tests
4. **Documentation** - Some patterns undocumented

### Low Priority
*(Nice to have, not urgent)*

1. **Bundle optimization** - Already small, but could be smaller
2. **Animation polish** - Functional but could be smoother
3. **Accessibility** - Basic support, could be comprehensive
4. **i18n improvements** - Working but could be more elegant

3. Identify production readiness blockers
4. Set up project tracking (if not already)

### Questions to Answer
1. What POS features are absolutely critical vs. nice-to-have?
2. What's the target production deployment date?
3. Are there any business constraints we haven't captured?
4. Who will be the primary users/testers?
